# A Manager Application

## For Pet Owners

This application manages the important health records of any owner's pet/s. It can be used by any pet owner that would
 like to store their pets' health information in one place!

As the owner of a cat, I understand the importance of having a convenient record of my cat's important health history
in one place, especially because my cat has a chronic illness. So, when I visit a vet, I would like to be able to
access my cat's important health information easily!
